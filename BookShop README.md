# Overview

This program is intended to be used as a book-shop inventory system. Whoever is using the program will be able to search through the book-shops records and determine if the book they are searching for is in stock or not availible. The program also records when a new book is bought or when a new one is brought in. 

The program was created so that I could better understand class structures in C++. I learned how to code in this language several years ago at a basic level and haven't really used it since then. This was a great oppurtunity to relearn the basics and advance my learning on it.
